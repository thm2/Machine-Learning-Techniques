# Salary inference and prediction from college data

## Data origins

The data was obtained from Kaggle link: https://www.kaggle.com/jessemostipak/college-tuition-diversity-and-pay/version/2?select=historical_tuition.csv). It originally came from the US Department of Education.

## Data background

As per the Kaggle description these datasets contains diversity statistics (e.g. number of Native Americans),
and tuition and fees for various United States college and universities, along with school type, degree length
and state. Moreover, historical tuition averages (e.g. over a few number of years) from the National Center
for Education Statistics, are also included. Moreover, it contains salary potential per university, and graduate
rates, and other information. A complete description of the datasets along with the various sources from
which the datasets were obrained can be found at: https://www.kaggle.com/jessemostipak/college-tuition-diversity-and-pay/version/2?select=historical_tuition.csv

## Brief introduction of the goal of this final project.

The goal of this project is to firstly analyze the College Tuition dataset and then build inference and
prediction models with the response variable being one of the dataset variables, and in specific, the sum
of their estimated early- and mid-career salaries. 

For the first part, an Explanatory Data Analysis will be
conducted which will analyze the dataset with respect to the nature of the variables included, what variables
should be kept, trends between variables (e.g. the costs of college tuition by geographic area, or estimated
salary trends) etc. For the second part, inference will be conducted initially, and inference conclusions will be
presented. Then, prediction models will be made for that response variable and the best will be selected
